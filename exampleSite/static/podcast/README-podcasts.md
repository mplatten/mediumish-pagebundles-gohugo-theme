Place your .mp3-files here in `/static/podcast/`.

In a page, embed a player with `{{< audio src="/podcast/<filename>.mp3" >}}`

This gives users the pssibility to listen to audio on pages, allthough it is not yet a true podcasting feature. But, this theme has RSS-Feed capabilities, taken from Daniel Saunders' Alpha-Church theme <https://themes.gohugo.io/alpha-church/>. If you inspect his code, you can easily add podcasting capabilities, so that you can use a Podcatcher to listen to new audio.
